### Hi there 👋
👩‍🔬 I'm a development scientist based in the West Midlands

💻 I became really interested in learning how to code after playing around with Microsoft Excel's VBA so I took the plunge and started learning properly last year!

💭 I have enjoyed building things and problem-solving with code but I also saw how useful it could be to automate tasks in my day job

✨ Projects I've worked on so far have helped me manage data at work using Python and VBA, along with doing some fun Python and SQL projects through Code First Girls courses

✍ I am currently learning full stack development with The Odin Project and am excited to see how I can take my coding skills to the next level and build fully-functioning websites!
